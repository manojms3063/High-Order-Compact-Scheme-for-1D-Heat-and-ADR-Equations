# High-Order-Compact-Scheme-for-1D-Heat-and-ADR-Equations
Python code for the numerical solution of 1D heat and advection–diffusion–reaction equations using classical and fourth-order compact finite difference methods.  Developed as part of my MSc thesis. Includes Crank–Nicolson time stepping, Thomas algorithm, and tests with constant coefficients.
